### This repo is about creating Vivado project and generating bitstream file
* First you should import ip generated from Vivado HLS. Since here we do not need FPGA pins constraints, .xdc file is not necessary.
* Then you can connect ip following the block diagram. Here you can set clock_wizard as 150MHz and set reset type activate low. Pay attention, you should note the start address
which automatically generated by Vivado address editor, it will be used in PS side when driving FPGA.

* Finally generate bitstream and export block design.
